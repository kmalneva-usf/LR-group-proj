  <h1>Weather Prediction Using Function-on-Function Functional Regression</h1>

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Since the government recently cut the national weather service budget, we want to try to help.
      We are trying to predict rainfall using temperature as the predictor.
      First we used synthetically generated data for San Francisco weather patterns.
      Then we took real data from the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS).
      Initially we chose 5 weather stations going back 10 years.

    <h2>Discussion of Basics – Why Not Just Linear Regression?</h2>
    <p>
      Linear Regression is a mathematical study of data analysis and prediction. 
      Linear regression uses a set of scalar predictors to infer some conclusion on a scalar response variable. 
      Functional regression is an extension of linear regression. The key difference between linear and functional
      regression is that functional regression uses integration instead of summation. It's more of an umbrella 
      term for various algorithms. In functional regression either the predictors or the response (or both) are a 
      function (usually of time).
    </p>
    <p>
      Functional regression allows better analysis and data prediction of one or multiple time series.
      It enables precise and thorough prediction of continuous or time-related data.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Functional Regression?</h2>
    <p>
        Functional regression is a branch of <strong>Functional Data Analysis (FDA)</strong> that has received growing amounts of attention and development over the past decade.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the paper <em>“Functional Regression”</em> by <strong>Jeffrey S. Morris</strong>:
    </p>
    <blockquote style="font-style: italic; background-color: #f2f6fa; padding: 15px 20px; border-left: 4px solid #004b91; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
        “Functional data analysis (FDA) involves the analysis of data whose ideal units of observation are functions defined on some continuous domain, and the observed data consist of a sample of functions taken from some population, sampled on a discrete grid.”
    </blockquote>
  <p>
    In contrast to simple or multiple linear regression, where a given observation, <em>X<sub>i</sub></em>, is a single data point,
    in functional regression, <em>X<sub>i</sub></em> refers to a function. In addition, the relationship between the response variable
    and predictor variables is modeled over a continuous domain such as <strong>time</strong> or <strong>space</strong>.
  </p>
    <p>Three common functional regression models:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scalar-on-function (SoFR):</strong> Scalar response, functional predictor</li>
    <iframe 
        src="func-sofr.html" 
        width="100%" 
        height="650" 
        style="border:none; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    </iframe>
    <p>
        This type of functional regression involves regressing functional responses onto a set of scalar predictors. 
        For example, we’d use this to predict total rainfall (scalar) if we had a weather related predictor(s) as function(s)/curve(s).
        An example of this would be predicting average daily rainfall using hourly average temperature for a given location.

        For this project, we utilized function-on-function (FoFR) regression to predict average 
        daily temperature and rainfall for 19 different locations within California.

    <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What does each type mean, and how would one determine which FR model to use?</li>
      <li>What are the pros and cons of FR?</li>
      <li>How does basis representation influence modeling?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="data">
    <h2>Data</h2>

    <p>
        In the final version of this project, we largely used weather data — specifically
        <strong>daily precipitation</strong> and <strong>daily average temperatures</strong> — for California from the
        <a href="https://cimis.water.ca.gov/" target="_blank">California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS)</a> website.
    </p>

    <h3>Messy Data</h3>
    <p>
        Obtaining, cleaning, and formatting the data to be usable in the model proved to be a significant task that our team initially
        thought would be trivial (classic!). We explored multiple data sources and initially planned to use
        <strong>Fitbit time series health data</strong> to predict another health metric. Specifically, we wanted to use Fitbit data
        (steps, calories, intensity) to predict total sleep minutes for various individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this dataset ended up being difficult to format for use in the functional regression libraries we were testing.
        Since this proved challenging, we decided to pivot and explore a different data source.
    </p>

    <h3>Synthetic Data</h3>
    <p>
        Inspired by other project teams using synthetic data generated with GenAI tools, we decided to explore this approach as well.
        We saw it as a good starting point, since synthetic data tends to be well-formatted and easy to work with.
        The idea was that once we confirmed the model worked with synthetic data, we could format the real data similarly.
    </p>
    <p>
        We generated <strong>synthetic San Francisco weather data</strong> (daily precipitation and daily average temperatures)
        spanning five years to help configure the model, using <strong>ChatGPT</strong> for data generation.
    </p>

    <h3>Final Data from CIMIS</h3>
    <p>
        While one teammate was working on getting the model to run with synthetic data, others were collecting real weather data.
        We obtained weather data from the <strong>California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS)</strong>, part of the
        California Department of Water Resources. One of our teammates had previously worked with this dataset as an energy consultant,
        which helped streamline our data collection process.
    </p>

    <h3>API vs. Manually Downloading CSV Files</h3>
    <p>
        The CIMIS website provides a convenient user interface for manually downloading CSV files for various weather stations across California.
        Initially, we used this manual approach to download about five datasets. Eventually, we looked into automating data collection using the CIMIS API.
    </p>
    <p>
        While experimenting with the API in a Python Notebook, we discovered a <strong>1750-row limit per API call</strong>,
        which was insufficient to cover five full years of data. This would require additional work to loop through multiple calls to collect everything.
        For this project, manual downloading was more practical, but for larger-scale research,
        automating data collection with the API would be far more efficient.
